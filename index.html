    <h1>Welcome to our <br>Cook Lab</h1>
    <p>
      Life gets a lot easier when you’ve got good food — and a bear who can actually cook. CookLab started as a small idea during exams, after instant noodles failed us one time too many.

      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>It all started with three friends, Osama, Bahaa, and Mohammad, who shared a love for food but struggled to cook anything edible. After countless failed attempts in the kitchen, they decided to turn their mishaps into a mission.</p>
      <p>CookLab was born out of their determination to make cooking accessible and fun for everyone, so no one has to endure the disasters they did. Join us as we turn failures into flavorful successes!</p>

      <div id="moreText" style="display: none;">
        <p>From burnt pans to undercooked meals, their journey was filled with laughter and learning. Now, they share their recipes and tips to help others avoid the same mistakes and discover the joy of cooking.</p>
